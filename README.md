# Algorithm Playground

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nutshellfool/algorithmPlayground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nutshellfool/algorithmPlayground)

This is a Java Language edition, and Python edition also available [algorithmPlayground_python](https://github.com/nutshellfool/algorithmPlayground_python).  

We use junit as the project unit test framework, as for the maven project structure, so you can run all test case by execute shell command  `mvn test -B`
